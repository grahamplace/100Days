Hi! I'm Graham.

<br>

Currently, I'm in Tucson studying Computer Science and Math at the University
  of Arizona, and formerly, I built [Opendoor Mortgage](https://www.opendoormortgage.co/)
  over at [Opendoor](https://www.opendoor.com/) in San Francisco.

<br>

While in San Francisco, I came to truly appreciate the value of building as a
  means of learning. Once I returned to Tucson to finish my degree, I realized
  that I needed to keep building things if I wanted to maintain my trajectory of
  growth.

<br>

And thus, I challenged myself to commit code (of any variety) every single day for
  100 days straight.

<br>

My goal is to learn something, _anything_ new every day. I won't be doing anything
  crazy or huge â€” instead, I simply want to get my hands dirty on as many new languages,
  frameworks, and open source codebases as I can.

<br>

This blog is a meta-project that will serve as the place where I track my progress
  through the 100 days and as my Day 1 code commit!

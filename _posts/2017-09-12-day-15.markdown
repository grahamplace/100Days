I've been incredibly busy with schoolwork this week, so today was another "Coding for
  School" day of this challenge. It's a little less exciting that way, but I still
  learn a ton from my hands-on class projects!

<br>

In my Compilers class, we're finally getting out hands dirty on some real compiler code;
  today, I wrote a Lex scanner to practice identifying tokens from an input file based
  on pattern-matching via regular expressions.

<br>

The project was relatively straightforward, though multi-line comments (think /*
  ... \*\/ if you're familiar with C) threw me for a bit of a loop. I had it working
  with an online regex tester using a lookahead approach, but I could only get it
  working in the Lex scanner using Start Conditions.

Unfortunately, I can't share my code here as it would violate my school's Code of Academic
  Integrity to share it publicly. I committed it to a private repo on GitHub to make
  sure I tracked today's commits!

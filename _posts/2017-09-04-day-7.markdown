For Day 7, I spent a bit more time on the skills progress bar script from Day 6!

<br>

Today was Labor Day, so I spent the day wrapping up camping with friends, golfing with
  my dad and brother, and having a family dinner at my parents' house. Not a lot of
  time to write code!

<br>

Nevertheless, I am determined to keep committing code every day, so after driving back home to
  my apartment across town, I finished up the progress bar I started working on yesterday.

<br>

Today I added the "Write" and "Display" functionality, and you can now see my "Skills Developed"
  progress bar on the homepage of this blog! Current version can be seen here:

[https://github.com/grahamplace/100Days/blob/master/scripts/skills.rb](https://github.com/grahamplace/100Days/blob/master/scripts/skills.rb)

<br>

Upon finishing these two portions, I realized that perhaps I need a fourth category: "Generate".

<br>

The script works perfectly, and generates the skills.yml file from the post markdown files whenever you run it.
  The problem is that _I actually have to run it_. I think tomorrow I might see if something like
  a git pre-commit hook that would generate the skills.yml file any time a new post
  is added might solve the problem. But, in the meantime, I got 4 hours of sleep in a hammock
  last night, so I'm going to crash! Plenty of days remaining to perfect things.

Day 4 meant more work on my [Day 3 project](http://www.graham.place/100Days/bash/2017/08/31/day-3.html),
coming up with a frictionless way to port my favorite terminal configuration to new
machines via a few interactive Bash scripts.

<br>
Here's the repo with the code I worked on today:
[https://github.com/grahamplace/gimmedatzsh](https://github.com/grahamplace/gimmedatzsh)

<br>

Day 3 wasn't very fruitful, but today I made far more progress! I read more about
  Oh My Zsh, and realized that I could add customizations programmatically via
  ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom as opposed to trying to edit the .zshrc file itself via
  Bash commands, which was giving me quite the headache last night.

<br>

Armed with this knowledge, I updated my scripts and got them working. Additionally,
  I made the installation and customization process interactive, letting users
  decide what to install. I also added checks to make sure the scripts don't overwrite existing
  installations of zsh and Oh My Zsh without asking the user first.

<br>

All in all, I think it came out well! I learned a bunch of Bash stuff that
  I didn't know before, and I was able to configure my own personal laptop
  using the scripts. Hopefully I can convince some friends to give it a go as
  well!

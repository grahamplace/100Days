It's Day 8, and the start of the second week of this challenge! Today in my Algorithms
  course (445), we discussed the "Stable Marriage Problem" â€” a classic algorithms problem
  that has implications in assigning medical students to hospitals, users to servers,
  roommates to roommates, and more. In fact, work on this problem domain won two economists
  a [Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012.](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/)

<br>

For a great primer on the problem, I would recommend the following Numberphile video:

I found the problem quite interesting, but my algorithms class is purely theoretical;
  that is, we only study algorithms, we don't actually implement them. Thus, I
  thought a great project to work on would be an implementation of the "Traditional
  Marriage Algorithm" (TMA), a standard solution the the Stable Marriage Problem.

<br>

With the time that I had to code today, I began work on my implementation, which
  can be found in the repo below. I decided to implement the TMA in Java as I am familiar
  with it, but also because I know my algorithms professor uses Java for the intro
  Algorithms class he teaches (345), which does include implementation projects. By using a
  language I know he is accustomed to grading algorithms in, my hope is that I can
  get his input on my implementation of the TMA we studied in his 445 class.

<br>

Currently, I pretty much only have a shell of the project, with the classes mostly
  fleshed out and the input file reading complete. Tomorrow, I'll work on the actual
  implementation of the TMA itself!

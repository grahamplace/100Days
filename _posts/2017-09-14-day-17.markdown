FINALLY! After banging my head against a wall trying to get the Spotipy python library
  set up, I have a working test!

<br>

Given the number of posts about oauth issues on Stack Overflow and the Issues page of
  the Spotipy GitHub repo, I'm inclined to believe that it's not just me struggling with this.
  As far as I can tell, Spotify recently changed their API's authentication protocol,
  and I'm not sure that the Spotipy library (or at the very least their documentation)
  has caught up.

<br>

Regardless, after reading through something like 8 different Stack Overflow solutions,
  I got my test script to correctly authenticate my user, and add a test track to a
  private playlist!

<br>

Now that I have that figured out, the actual scripting of pulling recent tracks,
  clearing the old tracks from the "Recently Played" playlist, and filling it back up with the
  most recent plays should be trivial.
